# BusinessCard-Reader
The project includes developing a Streamlit application that allows users to upload an image of a business card and extract relevant information from it using easyOCR. 
The extracted information includes the company name, card holder name, designation, mobile number, email address, website URL, area, city, state, and pin code. 
The extracted information is then displayed in the application's graphical user interface (GUI). In addition, the application allows users to save the extracted information
into a database along with the uploaded business card image. The database stores multiple entries, each with its own business card image and extracted information.

To achieve this, Python, Streamlit, easyOCR, and a database management SQLite are used. The application has a simple and intuitive user interface that guides users 
through the process of uploading the business card image and extracting its information. The extracted information is displayed in a clean and organized manner, and 
users can easily add it to the database with the click of a button. And Allow the user to Read the data, Update the data.
